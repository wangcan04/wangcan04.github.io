<h1>Can Wang</h1>

<p>
Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Can Wang</strong>, a researcher in machine learning and artificial intelligence.  
I completed my PhD at Leiden University, where my research focused on <em>automated machine learning for dynamic energy management using time-series data</em>.  
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Leiden University, working on enhancing time-series forecasting with AutoML and meta-optimization techniques.
</p>

<p>
Previously, I worked as a research scientist at Honda Research Institute Europe, pioneering applications of AutoML for electricity load forecasting.  
I also gained experience at the University of Sydney, National University of Singapore, and Optiver, exploring topics such as crisis communication analysis, deep learning for medical imaging, and algorithmic trading.
</p>

<p>
My interests include <strong>AutoML, time-series forecasting, deep learning, and large language models</strong>.  
I enjoy developing intelligent systems that adapt to complex real-world data.
</p>
